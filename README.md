# Four agent build pipeline

A Claude Code pipeline: architect, coder, tester, manager, driven by one `/build` command.

## Contents

    .claude/
      agents/
        architect.md    turns an idea into BUILD_PLAN.md, asks key questions first
        coder.md        implements the plan
        tester.md       breaks the code, writes TEST_REPORT.md
        manager.md      reviews the chain, returns GO / GO WITH FIXES / NO GO
      commands/
        build.md        /build command that runs the whole chain
    CLAUDE.md           context the session loads automatically

## Use on the web

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo (see below).
2. Open claude.ai/code, connect the repo.
3. Describe the build. The subagents load from `.claude/`, and the manager gates the result.

## Use locally

Copy `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/` into `~/.claude/` (all projects) or a repo's `.claude/` (that project), start `claude`, and run `/build <idea>`.

## Note

Keep `.claude/` out of `.gitignore`. The web session needs these files committed to load them.
